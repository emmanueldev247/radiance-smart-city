# Radiance Smart City

Welcome to the Radiance Smart City project repository. This real estate solution integrates cutting-edge technology to enhance security, energy efficiency, and emergency response systems.

## Features

### 1. Security

- **Boom Barrier System**: A sophisticated security measure using RFID technology. Access is granted only to valid cardholders, and the boom barrier can be controlled by security personnels using remotes.

### 2. Energy Savings

- **Street Light Control**:
  - **Automatic Mode (Default)**: LDR sensors ensure that street lights are turned on only in darkness.
  - **Manual Mode**: Remote control allows manual control of street lights.

### 3. Emergency Response

- **Fire and Flood Alarms**:
  - **Detection**: Sensors identify fire and flood incidents.
  - **Notification**: Immediate alarms and notifications through SMS and calls to the designated emergency agency.

### 4. Smart Bridge

- **Flood Response**: In case of a flood, the bridge is automatically raised using servo motors to a safe level.

### 5. Project Web App

- **A Comprehensive Community Hub**.
   - Order groceries, generate visitor codes, and report incidents seamlessly.
   - Contact security, report crimes, or emergencies for a safer and more connected community.
